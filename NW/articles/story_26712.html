1938 Violence surged in the Middle East during the Great Revolt (1936–1939) against British control of Palestine, which was 94 percent Arab. The story chronicled a particularly vicious outbreak of violence in July: “bombs hurled into crowds, individuals shot down in dark streets, wayfarers stoned and stabbed on the highways.” By the time the revolt ended, more than 5,000 Arabs had been killed. The British mandate finally expired on May 15, 1948, the day after David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the state of Israel. </p>

2000 As George W. Bush and Al Gore battled for the presidency, the Supreme Court was at an ideological tipping point. One new appointment, we wrote, “could decisively tip the court to the right or left” and potentially overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. With Justice Anthony Kennedy’s upcoming departure, the balance is poised to tip again.</p>
