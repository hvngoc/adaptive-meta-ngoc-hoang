Is disliking someone different than dehumanizing them? To find out, neuroscientist Emile Bruneau and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania’s Peace and Conflict Neuroscience Lab used functional magnetic resonance imaging—which measures brain activity—to evaluate feelings as participants were presented with a diverse range of people, including surgeons, the homeless, various nationalities and ethnicities. The participants first rated the groups in terms of “warm” (like) and “cold” (dislike). Dehumanization was then gauged by asking participants to place each of the people on the “Ascent of Man” scale—the well-known (and much-derided) image showing each step toward the evolution of modern humans. With both tests, the team watched for changes in the fMRI images. According to their results, published in May in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i>, dislike and dehumanization activated different regions of the brain. Because there are two distinct psychologies at work, it’s possible to dislike someone while still seeing them as human—which, researchers concluded, suggests a person can develop empathy and tolerance for 
people even if they don’t like them.</p>
