HER BRUTALLY HONEST 2014 MEMOIR ON TRANSGENDER IDENTITY, <i>Redefining Realness</i>, turned Janet Mock into the voice of the trans community. Producer Ryan Murphy (<i>American Horror Story</i>, <i>Feud</i>) loved the book so much, he ushered her to TV, hiring her as a producer for his latest show, <i>Pose</i>. The series, set in 1987, follows five trans women of color in the ball scene—famously documented by the 1990 film <i>Paris Is Burning</i>. In addition to the four episodes she wrote for Season 1 (ending July 22), Murphy asked her to direct Episode 6, “Love Is the Message.” The author and activist says she has “a notebook full of secret pitches” if FX renews the well-reviewed show. Being the first trans woman of color on a TV writing staff came with the “burden of representation,” she tells <i>Newsweek</i>. “If I had not done it well, then that door would then be shut right behind me.” But, she adds, “sidelining my career for a year, to give myself over to this world, is the greatest decision I’ve made.”</p>
<p><b>
You’ve criticized </b><b> <i>Paris Is Burning</i> </b><b>. What in particular bothered you?</b> </p>
<p>It ignored race and class issues. [The ball community] wasn’t just about queer and trans people. It was about people of color who don’t have many resources. My trans-ness cannot be removed from growing up black and poor in America. <i>Pose</i> hits that really hard; our characters talk about race and class, in ways that are appropriate for 1987 and 1988. You’re never, for example, going to hear terms like <i>intersectionality</i>.</p>
<p>The most heartbreaking part of <i>Paris</i> is the death of Venus Xtravaganza [found strangled in a hotel]. The film didn’t show the consequences of her death—her body is just disposed of. These women do not exist singularly in the world. They are a part of a loving community.</p>
<p><b>
How has the trans community responded to </b><b> <i>Pose</i> </b><b>?</b> </p>
<p>Overwhelmingly affirmative—like “I never thought I would see a show like this in my lifetime.” Laverne Cox broke barriers on <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>, but she’s not a central character and never shared a scene with another trans person, even in her backstory.</p>
<p><b>Do you and Ryan Murphy argue about anything?</b> </p>
<p>Beyoncé! I’m a card-carrying member of the Beyhive—she’s the queen of all queens. Ryan is very doubtful [<i>laughs</i>]—we go at it in the writers’ room all the time. He’s like, “Ugh, Janet 
and her Beyoncé.”</p>
